# A simple Perl script designed to run under the Android Scripting Environment:
# http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting. Designed to dispatch a text
# message when the phone's position matches the position entered by the user.
# For best results, start this program as a service.
#
# Text messages support 'tags' which are substituted for values before the
# message is sent. Currently supported tags are: 
#
#   admin_area 
#   country_code
#   country_name 
#   feature_name 
#   locality
#   postal_code
#   thoroughfare
#   sub_admin_area
#   map_link
#
# All tags must start and end with a '%' (percentage) sign. For example,
# if you would like to send a message as soon as you entered Cheshire to a
# chosen contact, and within that message you'd like to embed your current
# county and a Google Maps link, you could enter something similar to:
#
#   "Hi, I'm just entering %admin_area% now; link: %map_link%. See you soon!" 
#
# The tags in the above example would be substituted for their actual values:
# 
#   "Hi, I'm just entering Cheshire now; link:
#   http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.800651,-4.064941. See you soon!"
